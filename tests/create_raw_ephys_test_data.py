# The OpenEphys binary data format is described here:
# https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/User-Manual/Recording-data/Binary-format.html

# Each continuous directory contains the following files:

# - `continuous.dat`: A simple binary file containing N channels x M samples 16-bit integers in little-endian format.
# Data is saved as ch1_samp1, ch2_samp1, ... chN_samp1, ch1_samp2, ch2_samp2, ..., chN_sampM. The value of the
# least significant bit needed to convert the 16-bit integers to physical units is specified in the bitVolts
# field of the relevant channel in the structure.oebin JSON file. For “headstage” channels, multiplying by
# bitVolts converts the values to microvolts, whereas for “ADC” channels, bitVolts converts the values to volts.

# - `timestamps.npy`: A numpy array containing M 64-bit integers that represent the index of each sample in the
# .dat file since the start of acquisition.

# We could use SpikeInterface to read this data, but manipulating the data is easier with numpy since the data
# is a flat binary file.

# In Tim's data, the `continuous.dat` file contains 264 channels. The first 256 channels are the headstage (neural)
# channels, and the last 8 channels are the ADC channels.

# The `structure.oebin` JSON file and `settings.xml` contains metadata for the recording.

# To create test data of a reasonable size, we will trim the existing data and timestamps to 30,000 samples
# (one second of data) and 6 channels and save it to a new directory.

# We will manually edit the `structure.oebin` JSON file to remove the events and TTL channels and extra headstage
# and ADC channels. We will also manually edit the `settings.xml` file to remove the events and TTL channels and
# extra headstage and ADC channels.

# To run this script, copy Tim's open ephys data directory for IM-1478/2022-07-25_15-30-00 to your computer
# and adjust the paths in this script to point to the location of the data on your computer.

# Then run this script from the command line from the root of the repo:
#   python tests/test_data/create_raw_ephys_test_data.py
