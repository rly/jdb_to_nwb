# The MountainSort MDA file format is described here:
# https://mountainsort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mda_file_format.html

# SpikeInterface can read this format easily.

# In Tim's data for IM-1478/2022-07-25_15-30-00, the `firings.mda` file contains 145 units and 3,040,410 spikes.

# To create test data of a reasonable size, we will trim the spike times to only those in the first 30,000 samples.
# This results in 63 units and 462 spikes.

# To run this script, copy Tim's MountainSort output file `firings.mda` for IM-1478/2022-07-25_15-30-00
# to your computer and adjust the path in this script to point to the location of the data on your computer.

# The `firings.mda` file should be 72,969,860 bytes. The test checks specific properties of the file generated by this
# script.

# Then run this script from the command line from the root of the repo:
#   python tests/test_data/create_processed_ephys_test_data.py
